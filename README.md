# readability
Command-line program that returns the reading level of text input by using the Coleman-Liau index. The formula for the index is `index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`. This program was created as a project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course on EdX. 

### Functionality
This program was made to be used through your terminal.

To use the credit card number checker: use `python3 readability.py`

You will then be prompted for a `Text:` input. Enter a passage of text in order to have program determine the reading level grade - between Below Grade 1 to Grade 16+.


#### Ideas for improvements and changes
- Incorporate command-line argument to allow user to provide a text file as input instead of prompting user for input.
